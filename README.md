# Vulkan_RTX

This repository contains part of the work I (Daniel Fedai Larsen [@MuIattoKid](https://twitter.com/MuIattoKid)) did for my master thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. It explores the possibilities for calculating ambient occlusion in real-time using hardware accelerated ray tracing. The project utilizes Vulkan and the NV_ray_tracing extension. At the time of writing, this requires a Nvidia RTX GPU to run.
